              <p className="mb-0">
                1. An already placed order cannot be cancelled. The reflection
                period and revocation period of 14 days is not applicable in
                view of the digital nature of the products to be delivered.
                Thus, there is no reflection period and revocation period. The
                client therefore agrees to a direct delivery of the product
                after payment (both before and after) and explicitly renounces
                the reflection period and the right of revocation.

                2. The reason for deviating from the right of withdrawal is that
                a product cannot be returned because it cannot be ascertained
                whether the product has already been used. After all, it
                concerns digital products of which the seal is broken
                immediately after delivery. The nature of digital products makes
                any reflection period and the right of withdrawal impossible,
                except in case of delayed payment. In that case, the code has
                not yet been sent by the client nor received by the contractor
                and the product could still be revoked. For this, it is the
                customer who bears the burden of proof.
